# Deep Learning App with Streamlit

This project is a multi-page **Streamlit application** that demonstrates three types of deep learning models:

1. **Text Classification**
2. **Image Classification**
3. **Regression**

---

## Deployment

The application is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, as **Streamlit Cloud does not support TensorFlow**. Hugging Face allows deploying Streamlit apps with `.keras` models smoothly.

**Live App:**
